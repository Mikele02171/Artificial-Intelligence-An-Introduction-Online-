2. Concept of an agent
The word 'agent' stands for a broad concept in computer science. Anything can be considered an agent; that which makes actions based on what it detects. 
To put it more formally, an agent acts on its environment through its actuatorsâ€‹ based on what it perceives from its environment through its sensors.
Such a broad definition even considers humans as some sort of an agent. We have our five senses to perceive our environment, and we can act on it through our muscles.
 Even some software can be considered as an agent. Its sensors can be a keyboard, microphone or a hard drive reader. It's environment consists of what is showing on the screen 
or what is stored on the hard drive. It can act on its environment through playing sounds, showing pictures, or rewriting contents of memory.
Inputs, or what the agent senses through its sensors, are usually referred to as percepts. We will refer to the complete history of what the agent has perceived as its percept sequence.

Individual activity: Terminology about agents
Thus far we have introduced some basic terminology of what an agent does and how it can interact with its environment. If you read different sources about intelligent agents, 
you will find that some of the terminologies are a little bit different when referring to the same concepts. 

Watch Professor Michael Wooldridge introducing the concepts of an agent and its environment below.
 

Summary 
What is an Agent?
Automunous entities automany for itself that's capable of autonommous that having thr capability to decide 
for itself about its delegated goals.  

The main point about agents is they are autonomous capable independent action.
Thus: an agent is a computer system capable of autonomous action in some environment, in order to 
achieve its delegated goals. 

We think of an agent as being in a close-coupled, continual interaction with its environment:
sense-decide-act-sense-decide-...
In other words we think of agents being situated in some environment and engaged in a close coupled loop.
In order to decide for itself to find the best solution of how to achieve its delegated goals.


Simple (Uninteresting) Agents
Thermostat:
-delegated goal is maintain room temperature (within some certain range)
(environment changes makes another decision...)
-actions are heat on/off

UNIX biff program:
-delegated goal is monitor for incoming email and flag it
-actions are GUI actions

Simply incoming email, when you have a new email you can decide whether to raise the flag up or down.

They are trivial because the decision making they do is trival.



-Is the terminology that he uses the same or different from what we have introduced in this unit?
According to one source by definition an intelligent agent can perceives its environment, takes actions automonously
in order to set to achieve goals. Overall in comparision in terms what is discussed in this unit is fairly familar with given
real world examples and explainations given such as the termostat and UNIX biff program.




-How would you describe the structure of the agent (what it does and in what sequence), based on
Professor Wooldridge's description of the functional loop introduced in the video, 
in terms of an agent composed of an agent program, sensors and actuators?

We think of an agent program as being in a close-coupled, continual interaction with its environment.In
terms of an agent and understand its structure is to sense, decide and act and repeat upon whether we 
can achieve the best outcome or sequence. For example if we input a Python code sting "Hello World" and use the print function
print("Hello World") it's prints Hello World given us an output. We simply act and telling the computer system what to do
giving us our output. It we mistype our function prin("Hello World") the computer prints 
out an error message. Were basically telling or commanding the computer what to do based on our actions in which the computer senses it which
decides our output which automates out a feedback message or a solution. Considering its factors such as timing speed, space storage and data etc...


Group activity: Structure of an agent
Consider the following questions:

What actuators and sensors would an agent controlling a factory line checking for product quality have?
Student Answer:
I believe the sensors that an agent checking for product quality in a factory line would be 
sensors of weight, dimensions, and measurements of different attributes such as thickness and 
resistance, depending on the products of the factory line. 

Then depending on what the agent perceives (for example whether the product is under or over the standard weight),
 the agent then would make the decision of what to do with the product. 
The actuators could be the instrument that makes the compensating adjustments
 to reduce the variability or could also be the controller device that removes or keeps the product on the assembly line, 
in case the decision is to accept or reject the item.


What sensors and actuators would an AI agent trading stocks automatically have?

Assume that the AI Agent would use important market indicators as the perceptual data, such as: 
the stock price and market indices fluctuations, trading patterns across multiple markets, 
and other data collected from various sources, such as merges and acquisitions and economic indices.

The actuators could be the systems that create the sell or buy orders, 
and that performs trades or other operational actions,
like sending alerts when good opportunities appear.

5. Perfect agents


Scenario 1

'Could an agent taking risks and going faster be considered rational in this case?'

Student Response:
- This would seem rational from the perspective of solely reducing overall times but not rational given the inevitable 
undesirable consequences that would come about which would be unacceptable in this scenario.

Tutor response:
if the only goal of the agent was to arrive at the destination in the shortest amount of time then it would trade risk for speed. However,
 one would hope that transport agents would value the safety and health of its occupants and have goals for this too! However, 
the tradeoff between the two is more 'grey' and may depend on our personal goals (as humans) - and this may change from day to day! 
If we're late for work one day we may be tempted opt for a more risky (faster) tram if would get us to work on time...
 What does everyone else think about this? Would you tolerate a slight increase in failure to reach a destination quicker?

Scenario 2

Assume we are designing a rock-paper-scissors playing agent. What logic should a rational agent follow (assuming we just play a single game)?

Student Response:
- For one game there is logically no preference as all have equal probability of winning. However, I imagine that rock has a slight preference as a choice for a human agent
 (as seen as more robust when compared to the other objects), so when taking into account emotions, I'd say a rational choice would be to play paper in a one off game 
(against a human agent). This would entail knowing something on how humans 
approach decision making regards to values, judgments, preferences etc and using that information to inform decision making.

Tutor response:
that's an interesting point regarding the the choice of rock to show strength and robustness. 
I hadn't thought about this! You're right: as more games are played the AI agent can profile its opponent and anticipate choices. 
But that first choice is an 'unknown'... unless, the AI has access to historical data on its opponent or more general trends regarding first choices across a sample size of players... 
Do the rest of group agree? Would you choose rock first in a game of rock-paper-scissors for the same reasons? 
Is your choice 'random' or based on what you know about your opponent?

Summary:

BPMN is a standardised notation for modelling business processes. You can visualise as a sequence or parallel flows.

9. Model-based reflex agents

Individual activity: Model-based reflex agents
Consider the following questions:
1.
From a player's perspective, is the game of black-jack 
(a) stochastic/deterministic, (b) discrete/continuous, or (c) partially/fully observable?
The game of black-jack is assumed to be stochastic/deterministic because we can decide the 
actions without any knowledge where we hold/pass or hit from the player perspective in any given state where in.
.It can not be continous/discrete because if the player hits over 21 the dealer wins and hence the
player will lose. This will cause to start a new
round but this time the cards are shuffled randomly 
from the dealer as we can not observe or know what other cards the other players (if there is at least one player)
or the dealer has on hand.
(Not sure to discuss 
this on the board)

2.
Assume you are designing a stoplight. It has an internal clock that ticks every minute. 
It must show red whenever it's in-between an odd and even tick; it can show green otherwise. 
It can also receive input through pedestrians pressing a button to signal their wish to pass. 
Then, eventually, it must turn green for a minute, so they can safely pass.
It should be red for as much of the time as possible so vehicles can pass through. 
How many and what different states should it's model-based reflex agent be defined in?

We know that any clock that each contains 12 hours 
 on the clock with the hour the short hand and the minute 
hand the long hand. In terms of ticks assume it is the amount of seconds
where there is 60 seconds per minute.

Overall there are 6 states for the vechines to safely pass through. In states 
12 to 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 7, 8 to 9, 10 to 11 where the light turns green, 
otherwise the light turns red the model should be defined in. (Not sure to discuss 
this on the board)


11. Utility-based agents

Pause and reflect
Assume we have a robot moving on square tiles of a rectangular room trying
to get from some tile A to a specific tile B. It recognises if it has reached B, 
it is goal-based. However, it doesn't have a notion of proximity to the target tile.
It explores a possible set of actions by just walking in specific directions to find tile B.

What could go wrong?

Due to the possible number of different outcomes over a lengthy game, 
searching for a goal state through exploring every possible action sequence is infeasible.
In which there is no unique sequence the robot should follow.
Instead, it is preferable if the agent has access to estimating how useful a particular state is.
In order to acheieve the sutiable or best solution for the robot
to reach title B. 


12. Summary
Individual activity: Designing a (agent-based) vacuum cleaner
Consider the following problem similar to the vacuum cleaner instance mentioned earlier. 
There is an NxN tiles large room, and a vacuum cleaner starts off on one of its tiles. 
It can move to any neighbouring tile (if it is not hitting the wall, in that case, attempting the move doesnâ€™t make a change). The vacuum cleaner has no sensors at all; however, it can have an internal memory of its past actions.

Design a simple agent driving this vacuum cleaner, 
which would clear the room regardless of which tile it starts from!
You can describe your design as a list of tasks and rules or draw your solution using BPMN.
Share you solution in the Systems and agents forum and your tutor will 
post their model answer before the next unit begins.


(MORE TO ADD) But that is optional!
